# Right now we don't support lz4 on server side yet so we don't include this dependency since it doesn't offer pre built
# wheel and it substantially slows down base image build

# Workaround so we can use pre-built orjson wheel for musl. We need to pin pip to older version for
# manylinux2014 wheel format to work.
# See https://github.com/ijl/orjson/issues/8 for details.
# If we don't that and we include orjson and zstandard, we need rust chain and building the image
# will be very slow due to cross compilation in emulated environment (QEMU)
# TODO: Remove once orjson and zstandard musl wheel is available - https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/issues/305#issuecomment-922251777
