# This is a template of the script that can be used in a ScriptBuildStep (see agent_build/tools/build_step.py).
# PLEASE NOTE. To achieve valid caching of the build step, keep that script as standalone as possible.
#   If there are any dependencies, imports or files which are used by this script, then also add them
#   to the `TRACKED_FILE_GLOBS` attribute of the step class.

# Here are some environment variables, which are pre-defined for all steps:
#   SOURCE_ROOT - path to the source root of the project.
#   STEP_OUTPUT_PATH - path where the step has to save its results.

# If step has another steps that it depends on, then it can access their output directories from command line arguments.
# The order matches the order which is defined in the step class.
# Uncomment and edit this, if needed.
# DEP_STEP1_OUTPUT=$1,
# DEP_STEP2_OUTPUT=$2
